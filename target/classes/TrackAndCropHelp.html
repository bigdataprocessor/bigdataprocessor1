<h3>Object size</h3>
<p width=400>
    The tracking is based on computing the center of mass in a region whose
    size you can adjust here.<br>
    The "Object size" should be large enough <b>to enclose one</b> of
    your objects of interest, but small enough <b>not to enclose two</b> objects
    as this can cause the algorithm to 'switch' objects during tracking.<br>

<h3>Window size</h3>
<p width=400>
    The factor determines the window in which the algorithm will search for the object in the next time-point.
    The window size is:<br>
    <b>Object size * Window size</b><br>
    This needs to be large enough to cover the distance that the object moves
    between subsequent time-points. If the objects moves out of the "Tracking window" the algorithm will
    not find it anymore.

<h3>Tracking sub-sampling</h3>
<p width=400>
    You can specify binning (linear interpolation) in x and y, as well as sub-sampling in z and t.
    Especially when working with Tiff stacks sub-sampling in z will help as only every zth plane will be loaded from disc to RAM.
    Center of mass computation is so fast that binning in x and y makes no sense.
    For correlation-based tracking however x and y binning helps both in terms of speed and also for noise reduction.

<h3>Track length</h3>
<p width=400>
    Here, you can specify the number of frames that you would like to track the object.
    Please note that you do <b>not</b> need to start tracking at the first frame.
    Simply move the time slider on the image forward and then select an object and click
    'Track selected object'. Also note that you can track different objects for different
    lengths.

<h3>Bckground</h3>
<p width=400>
    Use ImageJ's measurement tools to determine the average gray values in the background around you object.
    The value you enter here will be subtracted before the center-of-mass or the correlation are computed.
    A correct background subtraction can have a big influence on the accuracy of the tracking.

<h3>Expand/crop the tracked region</h3>
<p width=400>
    The factor determines the size of cropped object view.
    The size is: Object size * Cropping factor.<br>
    If you put <b>all</b> instead of a number it will show the whole image.

<h3>Set nz</h3>
<p width=400>
    Click twice at different positions of the image's z-slider to set the z range.

<h3>Track selected object</h3>
<p width=400>
    Use ImageJ's Point Selection tool to select an object in the image and then
    hit this button to start its tracking.
    You do not have to wait for the tracking of one object
    to be finished; you can immediately start tracking another object.

<h3>Show track table</h3>
<p width=400>
    Shows a table with the current tracks.<br>
    Newly computed track positions will be added on the fly.<br>
    All columns can be <b>sorted</b> by clicking on the column names.<br>
    The currently selected object will be highlighted in the image.

<h3>Show tracked objects</h3>
<p width=400>
    Opens as many new image windows as there are completed tracks.
    Each image window shows the data locally surrounding the respective track.
    The size of the shown region can be adjusted by the changing the values in 'Cropping radii'.

<h4>Main ideas behind this functionality</h4>
<p width=400>
    One often wants to observe morphological changes of moving objects.
    It is however very challenging for the human brain
    to focus on the morphological changes as it is distracted by the object's motion.
    Thus, having a 'stabilized view' on the object, where its translocation is eliminated is
    very helpful.
    In addition, the 'stabilized view' also reduces the amount of data needed to further study the object.

<h3>Tracking Method</h3>
    <p width=400>
    You can choose between 'center of mass' and 'correlation'.
    For both methods, the manually entered background intensity is subtracted before the computations are done.
    </p>
<h4>center of mass</h4>
    <p width=400>
    The center of mass is very fast to compute.
    For 'center of mass' the position at each time-point is determined by an iterative (n=10) center-of-mass
    computation, where the size of the region in which the computation happens gradually shrinks from
        "Object size * Tracking factor" to "Object size".
    </p>
<h4>correlation</h4>
<p width=400>
For 'correlation' the position of the first time-point is determined as its center of mass.
    The position of subsequent time-points is determined relative to the previous time-point by
    computing the shift that yields the maximal cross-correlation between the signals.
